# RefGrab

This is a little extension for Google Chrome which makes it easier to collect Bibtext-formatted citations for papers. You just visit the journal (or arxiv) webpage for the paper you want to cite, and click the RefGrab button on the toolbar. The citation is copied into your clipboard.

I wrote this because every journal website has different behavior: some display text for you to copy (which may or may not be available as Bibtex), while some force you to download a file (which may or may not be Bibtex) which you then have to open, copy from, and delete. This gets old after a while.
